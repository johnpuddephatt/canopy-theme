      <h4>Canopy believes in people</h4>
      <p>We believe in giving people a chance because it’s what everyone deserves – that means we’re a place where people can try something new, make mistakes and then learn from the experience.</p>

    <div class="slide-third about-homes">
      <h4>Canopy creates homes</h4>
      <p>We believe that letting tenants choose what colour paint goes on the walls and what carpet goes on the floor is the difference between providing houses and building homes where people feel they belong.</p>

    <div class="slide-third about-community">
      <h4>Canopy builds community</h4>
      <p>We believe in improving neighbourhoods while helping each other. That’s why working with Canopy means joining a supportive community of people that shares humour, strength and skills.</p>
